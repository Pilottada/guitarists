"""
The package guitarists has a series
of modules aimed at creating an interface that 
lets users interact with a database that contains
names of bands and their corresponding guitarists.

Users can check if a name of a band or guitarist 
is present in the database, and if it is not present
then the program asks them if they want to add both band and guitarist
in the database.

Finally the user can see the database by themselves on the command
line so they can see all the list of guitarists and bands present in the database.
